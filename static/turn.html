      <p>Dave's Galaxy is currently running the turn, which takes
      approximately 1/2 hour.  The game will be back up soon,
      this is nothing to worry about.</p>
      
      <p>It used to be that the turn could run in the background,
      but unfortunately the game has grown too large for this to
      work properly with the current software.  I will be fixing
      this issue soon, but for now you get this charming message.</p>

      <p>Thank you for your patience!</p>
