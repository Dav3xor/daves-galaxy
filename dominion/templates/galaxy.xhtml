  <h3>About this Image</h3>
  <p>
    This is Dave's Galaxy, rendered as a 3000x3000 pixel png.
    each pixel represents one game unit in size, the stars are
    generally from .06 to .22 game units wide, and are slightly
    magnified when drawn to bring out more color.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'd like to overlay a current view of what areas are
    inhabited, who controls what, etc.  But I obviously haven't
    done that yet.
