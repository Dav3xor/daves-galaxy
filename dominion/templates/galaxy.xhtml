  <h3>About this Image</h3>
  <p>
    This is Dave's Galaxy, rendered as a 3000x3000 pixel png.
    each pixel represents one game unit in size, the stars are
    generally from .06 to .22 game units wide, and are slightly
    magnified when drawn to bring out more color.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 2nd image is the galaxy, with color showing which players
    own which sectors within the game.  I'll be making this clickable
    soon, but this will give you an idea of who's where, and you can
    hopefully find yourself.
