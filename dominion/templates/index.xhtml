New Dominion is a turn based strategy game designed for the casual

<p>
New Dominion is loosely inspired by a popular BBS door game from the late 
80's (Dominions), the game puts you in the position of the leader 
of a planet that has just discovered interstellar travel. 
</p>
<p>
You can make colonies on neighboring planets, build them through trade and protect them from other players.  As each planet increases in population and sophistication, you are able to build more and different types of ships there.
</p>
<p>
The game universe is very large; consisting of over 200,000 planets.  There is plenty of room for expansion and new players

<p>
Game play is centered around interacting with other players, and not 
necessarily by conquering them.  There are many paths to greatness in
New Dominion, only one of which is taking territory by force.
