  <h3>Origins</h3>
  <p>
    I started writing Dave's Galaxy towards the end of 2008.  Some of the
    ideas in the game have been kicking around in my head for 15 years or
    so.  I used to take walks, thinking about a strategy game that had 
    the look and feel of a petri dish on a vast scale.  When I got serious
    about writing something, I looked around 
    and saw games that take up huge amounts of time,
    games that mostly consisted of interacting with other players (fun),
    and doing meaningless tasks (grinding, not fun).
  </p>
  <p>
    In response, I wanted to make a game with no grinding, and replace it
    with slow development over time.  Many people  have likened Dave's
    Galaxy to a Play By Mail game, which isn't a bad comparison.  Whenever
    faced with a design choice that would eat up a lot of the user's time,
    I try to take the path of simplicity.

    With some notable exceptions, Dave's Galaxy is the product of one 
    person -- Me (Dave).  There's no corporation behind it, I'm not
    selling marketing tracking data to outside companies, I don't plan
    to sell it to Zynga (ugh).

    I am an Oregon native, born and raised.  I come from the southern part
    of the state (The Rogue Valley), and currently live in Portland.  I've
    worked for companies doing safety critical software (avionics and 911
    dispatching), graphics and music encoding/distribution.  I am open to
    contracting gigs, take a look at my

    The game was not originally named for me, I may be vain, but not quite
    <b>that</b> vain.  The domain name I wanted to use was taken however,
    and after a bit of a search, this is the name I came up with.  fairly
    short, memorable, and reasonably catchy.

  <h3>You Can Help Pay for my Server Bill!</h3>  
  <p>
    I <b>would</b> really like it if you would consider sending me a 
    donation (take a look at the <a href="/merch/">merchandise page</a>...),
    think of it as helping to forward the cause of good games.    Dave's 
    Galaxy is run on the NPR model of revenue generation --
    you should feel guilty if you don't send me money.  <b>GUILTY!</b>
